    "**Pandas** is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python.\n",
    "Pandas provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. To get started with pandas, you will need to get comfortable with its two workhorse data structures: Series and DataFrame. "
