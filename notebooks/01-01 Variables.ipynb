    "\n",
    "One of the main differences between Python and strongly typed languages like C++ or Java is the way it deals with the data types. In languages like C++ or Java, every variable must have a unique data type (i.e if a variable is of type string it cannot store integers or floats). Moreover, every variable has to be declared before it can be used, thus binding it to the data type that can be stored in it. Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when a value is assigned to a variable. This means that a variable that was used to store a string can now be used to store an integer. Try it out.\n",
