    "\n",
    "Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a teaching and scripting language and has since become an essential tool for many programmers, engineers, researchers, and data scientists across academia and industry. It can be used to create many things including web applications, desktop applications, as scripting interpreter and most relevant for you -- as a data analysis tool.. whether it is about '*making sense*' of the dataset that you are working with, scraping and cleaning the publicly available datasets or simply automating a task.. you will find python to be very agile to fit your needs. \n",

    "#### What is a Notebook\n",
    "The Juputer notebook (successor of Ipython notebook) is a web based interactive computational environment which provides a unique combination of code, shell environment and text. The Ipython notebook project that started of as a tool to provide the above mentioned functionalities just for python has since grown to be language agnostic supporting over 40 different languages and is now known as Jupyter notebook (or simply notebook). Simply put, a Jupter notebook is a [JSON](http://www.json.org/) document containing an ordered list of input/output cells which can contain code, text, mathematics, plots and rich media.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook combines three components:\n",
    "- **The notebook web application:** An interactive web application for writing and running code interactively and authoring notebook documents.\n",
    "- **Kernels:** Separate processes started by the notebook web application that runs user's code in a given language and returns output back to the notebook web application. The kernel also handles things like computations for interactive widgets, tab completion and introspection. \n",
    "> - The Jupyter notebook, for running python codes, runs an ipython kernel.\n",
    "> - If you are viewing this document on CUSP CDF and if you run any code, the code is not executed on your local machine. It is executed on the CDF server.. where the ipython kernel is running.\n",
    "- **Notebook documents:** Self-contained documents that contain a representation of all the contents visible in the notebook web application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, narrative text, equations, images, and rich media representations of objects. Each notebook document has its own kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why do we even use a notebook instead of .. lets say .. a terminal or some text editor?\n",
    "The notebook web application enables users to:\n",
    "- Edit code in the browser, with automatic syntax highlighting, indentation, and tab completion/introspection.\n",
    "- Run code from the browser, with the results of computations attached to the code which generated them.\n",
    "- See the results of computations with rich media representations, such as HTML, $LaTeX$, PNG, SVG, PDF, etc.\n",
    "- Create and use interactive JavaScript widgets, which bind interactive user interface controls and visualizations to reactive kernel side computations.\n",
    "- Author narrative text using the Markdown markup language.\n",
    "- Build hierarchical documents that are organized into sections with different levels of headings.\n",
    "- Use different cell types, for example, to include mathematical equations using $LaTeX$ syntax in Markdown, which are rendered in-browser by MathJax.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DIfferent Cell Types?\n",
    "Notebooks consist of a linear sequence of cells. There are four basic cell types:\n",
    "- **Code cells:** Input and output of live code that is run in the kernel\n",
    "- **Markdown cells:** Narrative text with embedded LaTeX equations\n",
    "- **Heading cells:** 6 levels of hierarchical organization and formatting\n",
    "- **Raw cells:** Unformatted text that is included, without modification, when notebooks are converted to different formats using nbconvert\n",
    "These cell types can be viewed by clicking `Cell -> Cell Type` in menu bar"

    "\n",
    "- ##### Edit Mode\n",
    "Edit mode is indicated by a green (or some different color than when you are not editing the cell) cell border and a prompt showing in the editor area. When a cell is in edit mode, you can type into the cell, like a normal text editor. To enter the edit mode, navigate to the cell and press `Enter`\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/00/new_edit.png\" alt=\"Jupyter notebook dashboard\" align='center'>\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### Command Mode\n",
    "Command mode is indicated by a grey cell border with a blue (or some different color than when you are editing the cell) left margin. To enter into command mode, press `Esc` key. This will bring you out of the edit mode\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/00/new_command.png\" alt=\"Jupyter notebook dashboard\" align='center'>\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### Keyboard Shortcuts\n",
    "In command mode, the keyboard is mapped to a set of shortcuts that let you perform notebook and cell actions efficiently.\n",
    "Its recommended learning the command mode shortcuts in the following rough order:\n",
    "- Basic navigation: enter, shift-enter, up/k, down/j\n",
    "- Saving the notebook: s\n",
    "- Change Cell types: y, m, 1-6, t (markdown in this case)\n",
    "- Cell creation: a, b\n",
    "- Cell editing: x, c, v, d, z\n",
    "- Kernel operations: i, 0 (press twice)<br><br>\n",
    "This will help speed up your development time.\n",
    "To know more about keyboard shortcuts, click: `Help -> Keyboard Shortcuts` in the menu bar\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Closing and Deleting a Notebook\n",
    "The notebooks that are currently open are shown in green icon on dashboard page. The notebooks will remain running until you explicitly shut them down. To do that, check the box next to the notebook that you want to close and observe the controls on top of the notebook.\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/00/closing.png\" alt=\"Jupyter notebook dashboard\" align='center'>\n",
