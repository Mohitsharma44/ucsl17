    "## 02 - 05 Exception Handling\n",
    "An exception is a python object that represents an error. It is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When such a situation occurs and if python is not able to cope with it, it raises and exception. We have been seeing errors like TypeError and NameError or IndentationError throughout our tutorial which caused our application or that code to stop the execution. To prevent this from happening, we have to handle such exceptions.\n",
