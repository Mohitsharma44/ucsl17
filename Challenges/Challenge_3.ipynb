    "# 2.  Find your \"weight\" on other Planets!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into assignment question, lets understand the difference between `Weight` and `Mass`. <br/>\n",
    "- Mass is a measurement of the amount of matter something contains, while Weight is the measurement of the pull of gravity on an object.\n",
    "- Mass is measured by using a balance comparing a known amount of matter to an unknown amount of matter. Weight is measured on a scale.\n",
    "- The Mass of an object doesn't change when an object's location changes. Weight, on the otherhand does change with location. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- If you are in a spaceship far between the stars and you put a scale underneath you, the scale would read zero. Your weight is zero. You are weightless. But when you are on Earth, your weight is *some* units, right? So it doesn't mean that you become massless in space. It's just that weight is calculated based on the force of attraction between you and the Earth (or any other planet).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Relationship Between Gravity and Mass and Distance\n",
    "As stated above, your `weight` is a measure of the pull of `gravity` between you and the body you are standing on. This `force of gravity` depends on a few things. First, it depends on your `mass` and the `mass of the planet` you are standing on. If you double your `mass [M]`, `gravity` pulls on you twice as hard. If the planet you are standing on is twice as massive, `gravity` also pulls on you twice as hard. On the other hand, the farther you are from the center of the planet, the weaker the pull between the planet and your body. The `force` gets weaker quite rapidly. If you double your distance from the planet, the `force` is one-fourth. If you triple your separation, the `force` drops to one-ninth. Ten times the distance, one-hundredth the force. See the pattern? The `force` drops off with the square of the `distance [R]`. This `force [F]` can be written in an equation form as:\n",
    "$$ \\huge F = G \\Big[ \\frac{Mm}{R^2} \\Big] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This force is applied on both objects equally and in opposite directions, toward each other. The value of `G` is currently known to be about `6.67e-11` which is why `gravity` is so weak - you can overcome the force of the entire planet just by jumping!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions:\n",
    "- We're going to assume all planets are perfect spheres. This means you can find the `volume [V]` of a planet, given its `radius [R]`, with the fomula $$ V = \\frac{4}{3}  \\times \\pi \\times R^3 $$ like a normal sphere. **(Do not specify the value of Ï€ as 4.13. Use `math` module for that.)**\n",
    "- We'll also assume they are made of a material which has the exact same density everywhere - so a handful of material from one bit of the planet weighs the same as any other. This means, given a `density [D]` (in kilograms per cubic metre), and using the `volume [V]` you worked out, you can compute the `mass [M]` of the planet with the formula $$ M = V \\times D $$\n",
    "- Assume the units you are using are kilograms and metres.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- The input will be `M` which is the `mass` of an object in `kilograms`.. example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "100\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Followed by a number `N` which will be the total number of planets on which the weight is to be calculated. This will be given as its `name, its radius (in metres), and its average density (in kilograms per cubic metre)`, example: \n",
    "```\n",
    "Mercury, 2439700, 5427\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Print the output as weight (in Newtons) of the object if it were at the surface of each planet, for example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Mercury: 314.623\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, finally, a complete working program should look something like below:\n",

    "Input: \n",
